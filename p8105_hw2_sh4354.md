# PROBLEM 2

Import and clean Mr. Trash Wheel Sheet

``` r
mrtrash_df =
  readxl::read_excel("data/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel", range = "A2:N549") |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  separate(date, into = c("year", "month", "day"), convert = TRUE) |>
  mutate(
    homes_powered = (weight_tons*500)/30,
    trash_wheel = "mister"
)
```

Import and clean Professor Trash Wheel and Gwynnda Sheets

``` r
proftrash_df =
  readxl::read_excel("data/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", sheet = "Professor Trash Wheel", range = "A2:M96") |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  separate(date, into = c("year", "month", "day"), convert = TRUE) |>
  mutate(
    homes_powered = (weight_tons*500)/30,
    trash_wheel = "professor"
)
  

gwynnda_df =
  readxl::read_excel("data/202309 Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", sheet = "Gwynnda Trash Wheel", range = "A2:K108") |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  separate(date, into = c("year", "month", "day"), convert = TRUE) |>
  mutate(
    homes_powered = (weight_tons*500)/30,
    trash_wheel = "gwynnda"
)
```

Combine datasets

``` r
trash_df = 
  bind_rows (mrtrash_df, proftrash_df, gwynnda_df) |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  relocate(trash_wheel)
```

The `mrtrash_df`, `proftrash_df`, and `gwynnda_df` datasets were
imported using `readxl::read_excel` and correspond to three different
sheets on an Excel document. Each dataset was cleaned using
`janitor::cleannames`, and the `separate` and `mutate` functions were
used to tidy the data, including calculating the number of homes powered
for each observation. The datasets were merged using the `bind_rows`
function because almost all of the variables were the same in each
dataset. By using the `bind_rows` function, we are able to see each
observation for each dataset, and a new column `trash_wheel` indicates
which dataset/trash wheel the observation comes from. There are 747
observations and 15 variables in the combined dataset. The variables are
trash_wheel, dumpster, year, month, day, weight_tons,
volume_cubic_yards, plastic_bottles, polystyrene, cigarette_butts,
glass_bottles, plastic_bags, wrappers, sports_balls, homes_powered, and
they provide information such as the date, amount of trash, and type of
trash collected. The total weight of trash collected by Mr. Trash Wheel
is 1748.36 tons. The total number of cigarette butts collected by
Gwynnda in July of 2021 is 1.63^{4}.

# PROBLEM 3

Import, clean, and tidy baseline demographics dataset

``` r
baseline_df =
  read_csv("data/MCI_baseline.csv") |> 
  janitor::row_to_names(row_number = 1) |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  mutate(
    sex = ifelse(sex == "1", "male", "female"),
    apoe4 = ifelse(apoe4 == "1", "carrier", "non-carrier"),
    current_age = as.numeric(current_age)
    ) |> 
  filter(age_at_onset != ".") |> 
  rename(study_id = id) 
```

    ## New names:
    ## Rows: 484 Columns: 6
    ## ── Column specification
    ## ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────── Delimiter: "," chr
    ## (6): ...1, Age at the study baseline, 1 = Male, 0 = Female, Years of edu...
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data. ℹ
    ## Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.
    ## • `` -> `...1`

The MCI baseline dataset was imported using read_csv. Since the first
row of the dataset consisted of the column names, janitor::row_to_names
was used to make row 1 values the column names. The column names were
converted to the proper format using janitor::cleannames. Next, to
convert the variables sex and apoe4 to character values instead of
numbers, the mutate function and ifelse statement was used. Finally, to
remove participants who do not meet the stated criteria of developing
MCI from baseline, non-values in the age_at_onset column were removed
using the filter function. The 6 variables in the dataset are study_id,
current_age, sex, education, apoe4, age_at_onset. Out of the 483
participants who were recruited, a total of 97 participants developed
MCI. Out of the participants who met the study criteria, the average
baseline age was 65.6113402, and the proportion of women in the study
who are APOE4 carriers is 65.2173913%.

Import, clean, and tidy amyloid dataset

``` r
amyloid_df =
  read_csv("data/mci_amyloid.csv") |> 
  janitor::row_to_names(row_number = 1) |> 
  janitor::clean_names() 
```

    ## New names:
    ## Rows: 488 Columns: 6
    ## ── Column specification
    ## ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────── Delimiter: "," chr
    ## (6): Study ID, Time (in years) elapsed since the study baseline to the v...

    ## • `NA` -> `NA...3`
    ## • `NA` -> `NA...4`
    ## • `NA` -> `NA...5`
    ## • `NA` -> `NA...6`

The MCI amyloid dataset was imported using read_csv. Since the first row
of the dataset consisted of the column names, janitor::row_to_names was
used to make row 1 values the column names. The column names were
converted to the proper format using janitor::cleannames. The 6
variables in the dataset are study_id, baseline, time_2, time_4, time_6,
time_8.

There are 487 observations in the dataset, which is more than the 483
that were in the original baseline demographics dataset. Therefore,
after cleaning the baseline demographics dataset, there are some
participants who only appear in the amyloid dataset and possibly some
participants who only appear in the baseline dataset.

``` r
mci_df = 
  inner_join(baseline_df, amyloid_df, by = "study_id")
```

The baseline and amyloid datasets were combined using inner_join so that
only participants who appeared in both datasets were retained. The
resulting MCI dataset contains 94 observations, which is less than
either of the original datasets since observations that only appear in
one dataset are not included. There are 11 variables, which is more than
either of the original datasets since variables in both datasets are
included.

save combined dataset as csv

``` r
write.csv(mci_df, file = "results/mci_df.csv")
```
